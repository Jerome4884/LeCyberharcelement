# LeCyberharcelement

# This is a project I started during my work placement at AEGIS-CIVIS. 

# The aim is to raise awareness of cyberbullying among children and parents.

# I used the Bulma framework and Bootstrap for the html/css part. 

# The back-end is in native php.

# This first part is complete. It will be improved as my skills increase. 

# The administrator part is currently being coded.
